<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Contribution</b> - This is the calculated <i>supervision contribution</i>.  The normal teaching contribution is 50% (i.e. with 40% for research and 10% for admin) and is made up from two components: <i>lecturing</i> and <i>supervision</i>.  A teaching contribution of 50% is equivalent to teaching four "standard" courses and, hence, each "standard" course gives a 12.5% teaching contribution.  One "standard" course is equivalent to 2.5 post-graduate supervisions (PGS), with a maximum of 3.5 PGS being counted. </p>
