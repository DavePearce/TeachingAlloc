<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p><b>Effective FTE</b> - This is the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent">full-time
  equivalent</a>.  It is considered "effective" because it is
  calculated from their contract FTE, and any additional buyouts
  (e.g. from grants).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><b>Base Hours</b> - This provides a "base" level of hours for
  each staff member.  This is primarily used to factor in ENGR489
  supervision at a rough cost of 50 hours per student.
