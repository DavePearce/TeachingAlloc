<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
Teaching begins with a 0.5 allocation, amended for significant admin responsibilites. The next column ("H") multiplies by the FTE to get the equivalent lecturing load expected of a fractional position.  The next column adjusts this for RSL, and the final column further adjusts for contract buyout.  Maximum contract buyout for teaching is 0.66, beyond this figure teaching reduces below zero (non-sensible).  the Total FTE is a check against the FTE in column D.

<p>
Full credit is given up to 2.5 PG supervision, then column U implements a decaying log scale.  Effectively 2.5 PG supervision is equivalent to one course, 5 PG students is equivalent to 1.5 courses.
</p>
<p>
The normal T&L allocation is 0.5, research 0.4, admin 0.1.
For PDs or major committee chair, T&L = 0.35, research 0.35, admin 0.25
For DHoS, T&L = 0.3, research 0.4, admin 0.3
For HoS, T&L = 0.2, research 0.2, admin 0.6
