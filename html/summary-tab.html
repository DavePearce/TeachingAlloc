<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Effective FTE</b> - This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent">full-time equivalent</a> teaching load for an individual.  It is considered "effective" because it is calculated from their contract FTE (e.g. part-time, full-time, etc), and any additional buyouts (e.g. from grants).</p></li>

<li><p><b>Research</b> - This is the research contribution (i.e. the ratio of time spent on research activities) for a given staff member.  Note, this does not include supervision, which is counted separately.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Teaching</b> - This is the calculated teaching contribution, which is made up from two components: <i>lecturing</i> and <i>supervision</i>.  See "Teaching" for the complete calculation, and more information on how it is calculated.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Admin</b> - This is the admin contribution for an individual.  See "Staff" for more information on this.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Overall</b> - This is the overall calculated workload, which is the calculated workload over the effective FTE.</p></li>
</ul>
