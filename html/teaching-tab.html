<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Hours</b> - This is the calculated <i>teaching hours</i>.  The hours for a course are calculated at <code>150 + n</code>, where <code>n</code> is the number of enrolments.  This is then distributed to staff based on their load for the course.  Course Coordinators get a bonus 20%.  Lecturers on new courses, or who are teaching a course for the first time, get an additional 0.50 bonus.  Likewise, new staff are given a 0.5 bonus for their first two years (<b>note:</b> this differs slightly from the <a href="https://ecs.victoria.ac.nz/Staff/TeachingAllocation">official workload model</a>).</p>
